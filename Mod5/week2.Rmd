## Loading and preprocessing the data

And loading of necessary library.

```{r, results='hide',warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
df = read.csv("activity.csv")
df$date = as.Date(df$date)
head(df)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

#### 1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
df_step = df %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(Steps = sum(steps))

head(df_step)

barplot(Steps ~ date, data = df_step, main= "Total Steps by day")
```

#### 2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
hist(df_step$Steps, main = "Histogram of total steps per day", xlab = "Days")
```

#### 3. Report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
meanSteps = mean(df_step$Steps,na.rm=1)
medianSteps = median(df_step$Steps,na.rm=1)

```

The mean and median of the total number of steps taken per 
day are `r sprintf("%.2f", meanSteps) ` and `r medianSteps` respectively.
